# Project Photos and Reports Functionality

This document explains how to set up and use the new photo and report functionality for your Home Build Pro project.

## üóÑÔ∏è Database Setup

### 1. Create Required Tables

Run the following SQL commands in your MySQL database:

```sql
-- Create tables for project photos and reports functionality

-- Table for storing project photos
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS project_photos (
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    project_id INT NOT NULL,
    user_id INT NOT NULL,
    photo_url VARCHAR(500) NOT NULL,
    photo_name VARCHAR(255),
    description TEXT,
    file_size INT,
    file_type VARCHAR(50),
    uploaded_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP ON UPDATE CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    FOREIGN KEY (project_id) REFERENCES projects(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    FOREIGN KEY (user_id) REFERENCES users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    INDEX idx_project_photos (project_id, uploaded_at),
    INDEX idx_user_photos (user_id, uploaded_at)
);

-- Table for storing project reports
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS project_reports (
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    project_id INT NOT NULL,
    user_id INT NOT NULL,
    report_title VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    report_description TEXT,
    report_file_url VARCHAR(500) NOT NULL,
    report_file_name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    file_size INT,
    file_type VARCHAR(50),
    report_type ENUM('progress', 'financial', 'technical', 'safety', 'other') DEFAULT 'other',
    status ENUM('draft', 'published', 'archived') DEFAULT 'published',
    uploaded_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP ON UPDATE CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    FOREIGN KEY (project_id) REFERENCES projects(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    FOREIGN KEY (user_id) REFERENCES users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    INDEX idx_project_reports (project_id, uploaded_at),
    INDEX idx_user_reports (user_id, uploaded_at),
    INDEX idx_report_type (report_type, status)
);

-- Table for tracking photo/report views by members
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS project_content_views (
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    project_id INT NOT NULL,
    user_id INT NOT NULL,
    content_type ENUM('photo', 'report') NOT NULL,
    content_id INT NOT NULL,
    viewed_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    FOREIGN KEY (project_id) REFERENCES projects(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    FOREIGN KEY (user_id) REFERENCES users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    UNIQUE KEY unique_view (user_id, content_type, content_id),
    INDEX idx_project_views (project_id, content_type),
    INDEX idx_user_views (user_id, content_type)
);
```

### 2. Create Upload Directories

Create the following directories in your backend:

```bash
mkdir -p BE-main/public/uploads/projects
mkdir -p BE-main/public/uploads/reports
```

## üîß Backend Setup

#### Reports
- `GET /api/projects/:id/reports` - Get project reports
- `POST /api/projects/:id/reports` - Upload project report

#### Content Tracking
- `POST /api/projects/content/view` - Track when members view photos/reports

## üì± Frontend Setup

### 1. Install Required Dependencies

```bash
npm install expo-image-picker expo-document-picker
```
